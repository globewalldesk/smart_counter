The idea behind Smart Counter is that I ought to be able to press a button after
doing each of some task (in my case, finishing a SuperMemo question) and then
I get various bits of feedback.

The basic structure needed for the program is simple: an array of Time objects.
Each time "enter" is pressed, current time is fetched and appended to the array.
The program then simply spits out a series of statistics.

What statistics? Well, the biggies I'm interested in are:
# Number completed in last minute.
# Number completed total.
# Numbers completed in last five minutes; and in all minutes.
# Per minute average of last five minutes.

Then there are things I'd like to save, eventually (the first version needn't
have these):
# Daily history (going back indefinitely).
# Start new collection/task (so I can label sessions "Ruby," "JS," etc.).
# Pause and continue. (Not sure exactly how this should work.)
# Delete last timestamp. (In case my finger slips.)
